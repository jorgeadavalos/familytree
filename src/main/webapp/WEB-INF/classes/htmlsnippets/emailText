Hi _________:

It’s always so hard to get in touch with family members in our big family. So I have started using the Family Tree application to have an easy way for all family members to contact others. 

The idea is to have a way to be in touch, to send holiday cards to everyone or to send a text to a cousin you haven’t seen for awhile.
